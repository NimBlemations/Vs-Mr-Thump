The secret is to make it last longer by cutting it up, and extending time by going to the next sound.

Especially charting, make a text fill thingy and put in name of song music thingy idk.

But for god's sake, it better not fuckin be Psych Engine I will whip yo ass.

Don't even try to twist it by making your own engine with Psych Engine ffs.
